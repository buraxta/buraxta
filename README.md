## 💻 Technologies I Use

I'm always experimenting with new technologies and tools to bring my ideas to life. Here are some of my favorites:

- **HTML** 🌐: The foundation of all my web projects.
- **CSS** 🎨: A powerful styling language that brings my designs to life.
- **JavaScript** 🌟: The backbone of my dynamic web applications and games.
- **jQuery** 💡: A fast and concise JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and animation.
- **Sass** 💅: A CSS preprocessor that streamlines my workflow and helps me write cleaner code.
- **Bootstrap** 🛡️: A popular front-end framework that accelerates my development process.
- **React** ⚛️: A powerful front-end framework that helps me build beautiful UIs quickly.
- **Node.js** 🚀: The perfect backend platform for scaling services and APIs.
- **Express** 🔥: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js that allows me to build robust APIs.
- **MongoDB** 🍃: A flexible NoSQL database that plays well with Node.js.
- **SQL** 🗃️: The go-to language for relational databases.
- **Java** ☕: A versatile programming language that I use to build enterprise-level applications.
- **Spring** 🌸: A powerful Java-based framework for building enterprise-level applications.


By using a combination of these technologies, I can create vibrant and interactive projects that captivate audiences and solve real-world problems.

## 🌈 Fun Facts

- I never say no to a good cup of coffee ☕️
- When I'm not coding, I love to spend time socializing with friends and family 👫. Whether it's trying out a new restaurant, watching a movie together, or just having a game night at home, I believe that spending quality time with loved ones is important for both mental and emotional well-being. Building relationships and making memories with the people in my life is just as fulfilling to me as creating something with code.
- I am proud to have placed second in the Orienteering Championship of Turkey 🏆. It was an incredible experience to compete against some of the best orienteers in the country and push my limits. This accomplishment taught me the importance of perseverance, dedication, and teamwork. Through countless hours of practice and preparation, I was able to hone my skills and achieve my goal. I will always remember this moment as a reminder of what can be accomplished with focus, discipline, and passion.
